# LoopCrate Update 8/18/25

**Big update for LoopCrate: Loop Packs!**

Instead of uploading one loop at a time, producers can now bundle multiple loops together into a cohesive pack. This makes it easier to share full collections built around a theme, vibe, or concept.

**What’s New:**

**Single Loop or Pack Upload Select** – Choose whether you want to upload a singular loop or a batch of loops.

**Shared Artwork** – Give your pack its own cover art.

**Pack-Wide Tags** – Apply consistent tags across the whole collection.


This means LoopCrate is no longer just about single loops, it’s becoming a place where producers can release curated packs in a way that feels organized and professional.

**Smaller Update: Explore Page Filters**

Alongside packs, we’ve also made improvements to the Explore page. You can now filter loops and packs by:

BPM ranges

Keys


These filters make it much easier to dig through the catalog and find exactly what you’re looking for.

This is a big step toward making LoopCrate not just a loop-sharing site, but a platform for producers to publish and discover full sound collections. Everything is still a work in progress, but this update lays a strong foundation.
